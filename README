===================
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
===================

For CheckpointTwo, the following was implemented: 
      • Symbol Table that maintains all declarations within program
      • Type checking validation for all types of operations within program 

=========================
BUILDING AND TESTING PLAN
=========================

This program uses both jflex and CUP as part of the application. These must be installed on
your system for the build to be successful. These build instructions also assume that javac is
a usable command on your computer, and that you are building on a Linux environment.

Building
-----------

  Note that you need to modify the paths for CLASSPATH, JFLEX, and CUP in 
the Makefile so that the related commands can be found on your particular 
machine. 

  To build the parser, type "make" in the current directory, which will 
generate an executable program called "CM".

  If youd like to produce a syntax-tree for the input file you will need to 
  add a "-a" flag to the command line.

  If youd like to produce the symbol table for the input file you will need to 
  add a "-s" flag to the command line.

  For example, to test source code like "fac.cm", type 

    "java -cp java/java-cup-11b.jar:. CM -s -a testfiles/fac.cm " 

  Sytax tree and symbol table output will be redirected to .sym and .abs files respectively.

  To rebuild the parser, type "make clean" and type "make" again.

  Also note that all the abstract syntax tree structures are defined under
the directory "absyn" and the methods for showing a syntax tree is implemented
by the visitor pattern in "ShowTreeVisitor.java".  Since some java files are 
generated automatically, they may contain variables that are not used, which 
are safe to ignore in the compilation process.


Testing 
-----------

  This parser is meant to take C- programs as input files. We have provided
  [12345].cm files to test with, however any C- program files will work. 

===========================
ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS
===========================

 1. Assume testing will be with errors of scope relaated to assignment
 2. This program will work with any files of C- spec
 3. We have follwed the reccomended examples of declaration and type-checking errors and have done 
    recovery for all provided. Only limitation is the number of parameters in a function. Our program
    doesnt recognize mismatch between function dec and call.

====================
FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS
====================

1. We could improve on our code structure and handle the symbol table more efficiently 
2. More in depth type checking could be done for the funtion parameters
